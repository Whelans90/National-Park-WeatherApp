# National-Park-WeatherApp
Created a web app developed with Java, utilizing HTML, CSS, JSTL, and Spring MVC


This project was a paired programming assignment, my contribution was anything that was not CSS. For the assignment we were provided with a spec, and a database. Then we built the project from scratch, working to accomplish all of the details outlined in the spec. This capstone was designed to exercises serverside skills. There is no JavaScript, or Jquery that was applied to the client side. The webapp was hosted on a local Tomcat Server, and is no longer live. Feel free to pull the code and run it on a local server yourself.
